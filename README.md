# 🛍️ Balarama Price List Platform

**Balarama** is a simple yet functional web platform that allows authenticated clients to browse a product list sourced from a Google Sheet, add items to a cart, and send their order via **WhatsApp or email**.

This project was originally a static price list. I was hired to turn it into a full-featured ordering system with user authentication and product interaction.
